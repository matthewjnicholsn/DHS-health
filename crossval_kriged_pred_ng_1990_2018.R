# need to write a function to take a value of i in a column of one df
# and subtract it from the value at i in the same column of another
#need the results from kriging for the different sample protocols
#this one will be the regular full sample kriging
kriging_results_ng_2018_full
#this will be the one kriged with the sample sliced to 50% sample by cluster
kriging_results_ng_2018_half_byclust
#this will be the one kriged with the sample slice 50% random (ie., some clusters could be absent)
kriging_results_ng_2018_half_random
#may also want one where I include a random sample of clusters
