HV108-HV109    In 1988 the number of grades to complete secondary education
               changed from 5 to 6. The computation of the education in
               single years (HV108) and educational achievement (HV109) are
               based on highest level and grade within that level attended.
               Since no additional information is available, it was assumed
               that secondary education still consistuted of 5 grades, thus
               underestimating the education in single years for those who
               graduated from secondary school after 1988 and
               overestimating the educational achievement for those who
               left secondary education in grade 6 after 1988 or attended
               this grade at the time of the survey. However, since the
               survey was held in 1990, this should affect very few cases.

V313      Foaming tablets are included under modern methods of
          contraception.

V326      Whether hospital or health center etc. are operated by the
          government or by a mission or private organization is derived
          from Q320. Q321 was used to determine whether the doctor is at a
          government facility or a mission or private organization. The
          source of the other categories is Q319.

V327      Hospital, health and maternity center, family planning clinic,
          or health clinic/post are grouped under Government
          clinic/pharmacy. Planned Parenthood Federation under NGO. Doctor

          source of the other categories is Q334.

M2D       Country specific health profession: village health worker.

M3D       See M2D above.

M15       The categories health clinic/post, health center, maternity
          center and hospital are listed under the public sector since no
          information pertaining to what institution is running these
          facilities is available.

M24       Only one category: child was given plain water and other liquids
          was used in the NDHS. Therefore, M24 (was child given plain
          water?) was put to NA and M25 (was child given other liquids?)
          includes both plain water and other liquids.

REC42

V413A     Country specific other fluids: soya milk.

V416      Code 2 (heard of ORS) is not availble, since this question is
          not included in the questionnaire.

V420-V421 The codes assigned to the person measuring height and weight and
          to the assistant consist of three digits in Nigeria, not the
          standard two digit code, and these variables have therefore been
          transferred to the country specific listing (S810M and S810A).

V423      Responses recorded as bottle sizes (soft drink bottle and beer
          bottle and beer bottle) are recorded into their estimated sizes
          (e.g. 290 and 580 ml.). Since the contents of a cup is not
          defined answers given in cups are coded as 9996.

V425      Since additional information is not available the categories
          village health worker, health clinic/post, health center and
          hospital are listed under the public sector.



REC43

H12A - H12E    See V425.

H13       Category 1 (respondent spontaneously reported use of ORS) is not
          used, since this question was not included in questionnaire.

H13A- H14A     The question on number of days given ORS was combined with
               the number of days that home-made fluids were given to the
               child. Q473 (Was child given ORS) and Q474 (Was child given
               home fluid) were used to separate the number of days ORS and
               home made fluid were provided.

H31       No specific information on cough during the last 24 hours
          available. The categories 1 (during last 24 hours) and 2 (during
          2-14 days) are collapsed into 2 (during last 14 days).

H32A-H32Z See V425. The category þmyself/relativesþ listed under H32U.
          Market traders under H32V and other under H32X.

REC61

V616      Categories 992 (any time)  and 993 (up to God) added.

REC71

V705-V717 For partnerþs employed in agriculture no distinction is possible
          between self-employed and employees; both are combined in
          category 4: agriculture. Likewise no distinction is possible
          between skilled and unskilled manual. Both are combined in
          category 8: production workers. Students and applicants are
          listed under 0 (never worked) and the category other is
          transferred to 96.

Notes on inconsistencies in the Data File

 1.  10 Households are listed as having no de jure residents (HV012).

 2.  There are 607 cases where child attended shool (HV110) and was less
     than 6 years of age, indicating that there was no lower cut off age in
     the household questionnaire or pre-primary was erroneously classified
     as primary. Furthermore, there are 20 cases where children aged six
     and over reported a grade that would imply that they started primary
     education before age 6.

 3.  There were 20 individual questionnaires dated (V008) before household
     questionnaire (HV008).

 4.  There is one woman whose response to whether she is a usual resident
     or a visitor is missing  in the household (HV102) and the individual
     questionnaire (V135). She slept in the household (HV103) and was
     included in the individual questionnaire.

 5.  Eight woman reported to have borne a child before age 10 (B3 and
     V011).

 6.  Three women were recorded as not currently using contraception (V312),
     but their husband as sterilized (V305).

 7.  There is one case were duration of breastfeeding (M4) exceeds age of
     child (B3 and V008)

 8.  Four women reported never to have menstruated, but to have children,
     therefore V227 = 8, but also responded on another question that period
     returned, therefore making reponses to M6, M7 and M28 inconsistent
     with V215, V226 and V227.

 9.  Four respondents reported no health card  (M12), not to know the
     timing of antenatal visits (M13), no antenatal visits (M14),  but
     mentioned  some kind of prenatal care (M2N). One repondent reported no
     prenatal care and M12, M13 and M14 are recorded as missing.

10.  There are 2 cases were age at which solid foods are provided (M26) is
     higher than current age of child.

11.  There is one case with first entries on health card (H2D-Y, H3D-Y,
     H4D-Y) before birthdate of child.

12.  For 123 cases the reported date of vaccination was  within 7 days
     after previous vacination  (H2D-Y, H3D-Y, H4D-Y.

13.  Seventy women reported to have married before age 10 (V509).

13   There are 100 cases where the reported age at first intercourse (V525)
     came after the age at first birth (V202).
