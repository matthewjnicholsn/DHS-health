Notes on the recode

1.   There are 18 domains (HV023 and V023) that come from the combination of the
     10 provinces in the country and "Urban/Rural".  Harare and Bulawayo provinces
     do not have rural clusters.

2.   Variables that refer to locality of the place of the interview (HV026, V026,
     V134) were created from the variable locality (main town/other urban/rural)
     on the front page of the questionnaire.  However, the category "Main town"
     was split into the categories "Capital, large city" if the interview was done
     in Harare and "City" for the remaining cases.

3.   Variable V034 was created by identifying those women who were declared as
     being the wife of men interviewed in the male survey and that at the same
     time were interviewed in the women's questionnaire.  Women who were not
     declared as being the wife of any of the males interviewed, were assigned a
     code "0" (Husband not in the household).  In the core questionnaire this
     variable comes directly from a specific question asking for the line number
     of the husband in the household schedule.  This variable should be used when
     linking the female and male data files.  There are 703 women who have a match
     with the men questionnaire.  However, 5 of them reported that they are not
     currently married, but it was decided to leave them as couples because of the
     different perceptions of marital status in Zimbabwe.

4.   In variables V103 and V141 (for non-dejure respondents) it is not possible
     to differentiate "main town" from capital or large city.  Because of that
     "main town" was classified with the code "1-city".

5.   Variables V242A to V242Z are not applicable because unlike the core
     questionnaire, the Zimbabwe Q630 is not a multiple choice question.  Q630 was
     kept as country specific.

6.   Variable V217 applies only to those women currently using "periodic
     abstinence"

7.   Variable V325 (cost of pills) has two decimals.  In order to properly use it,
     it has to be divided by 100.  Codes 999996 and 999998 are "free" and don't
     know respectively but because of the number of digits it could not be
     labeled.

8.   Questions 339, 344, and 762 are used to generate the variables V326, V379 and
     V762 respectively; code 14 is "ZNFPC mobile clinic".  This label was changed
     by "ZNFPC clinic" in order to include both the mobil and fixed ZNFPC clinics.
     Code 17 was collapsed with code 16, because all the community based
     distributors ultimately come from ZNFPC.

9.   Variable V326 (source for current users) is derived from questions 328 for
     sterilization and 339 for other modern methods.  Codes 11, 12, and 13 from
     Q328 (Central hospital, provincial hospital, and district/rural hospital)
     were collapsed as "government hospital/clinic", because they are all
     government hospitals.  In the final report, however, they were collapsed as
     government hospital/clinic, rural/municipal clinic, and rural health center,
     respectively.  In order to preserve the original codes Q328 was also kept as
     country specific.

10.  Due to the skip pattern regarding current use of contraception for currently
     pregnant women, in  variable V375A (main reason not using a method) code 27
     (pregnant) was assigned to those women who had ever used a method and are
     currently pregnant.  Note that this code does not exist in the questionnaire.

11.  Variables V384A to V384E in Zimbabwe refer to the last six months.  In the
     core questionnaire they refer to the last few months.

12.  Question 353 was kept as country specific because in Zimbabwe the base for
     it is all non-pregnant women, whereas in the core it is for non-pregnant non-
     users of modern methods.

13.  The number of days that porridge and fruit/vegetables were given are kept in
     M40I and M40J respectively.

14.  Variables H12x and H32x were recode as follows:  Central hospital in
     H12A/H32A, Rural health centre as H12B/H32B, Provincial hospital in
     H12F/H32F, District/rural hospital in H12G/H32G, Rural/municipal clinic in
     H12H/H32H,  Other public in H12I/H32I, Mission hospital/clinic in H12P/H32P.
     All the remaining categories were assigned to their corresponding variables
     in H12 and H32.  H12F/H32F, H12G/H32G and H12H/H32H can be considered as
     government hospitals but they were kept separately, so that the original
     questions were not lost.  Mission hospitals are in part supported by the
     government but their main source of support comes from religious
     organizations.

15.  In variables V705 and V717 the occupations related to agriculture were recode
     as self employed, since there is no way to determine from the original
     questions (Q705, Q711) if those categories are either employed, or self-
     employed.

16.  In variables V707 and V740 the original category "2-communal/resettlement
     land" from questions Q707 and Q713 was recoded as "family land".  The reason
     is that this land is assigned by the government and passes within the family
     from generation to generation, although there are no documents of ownership.
     (check with George)

17.  Respondents who had never had sex (V525 = 0) skipped questions on future use
     (V362, V363, V364 and V375A) as well as attitude towards becoming pregnant
     (V606).  Variables V362 and V364 were assigned codes 6 and 5 respectively
     (never had sex).  Fertility preferences for those respondents (V602) who at
     the same time are married were classified with code 6 (never had sex).

18.  Maternal mortality variable MM14 (number of sibling's children) was asked
     only for those siblings who died as a result of a pregnancy or child delivery
     complication.  Variable MM10 was asked of siblings whose death was related
     to pregnancy or delivery, unlike to the core questionnaire that asks the
     question only of those women who died while pregnant or within the two months
     after giving birth.

19.  Variable V399 (currently relying on breastfeeding) was asked regardless of
     whether the respondent is using sterilization.

20.  Variable M39 (times ate other food yesterday), was asked of all children
     except for those currently being breastfed who did not receive any other food
     in the last 24 hours.  In the core questionnaire this variable is only asked
     of those children who were given any liquids or solids in the last 24 hours.

21.  Variables related to education of the household members were asked of
     children 5 years and older.  The core questionnaire asks these questions to
     children 6 years and older.

Inconsistencies in the file

1.   There are 2 cases in which the head of the household is not the first line
     in the household schedule.  In 12 more households there are no adults that
     are usual residents of the household, they were assigned code 0 in HV217.

2.   There are 27 cases of children under 15 years of age in the household
     questionnaire, for whom either or both the sex of the line number (HV112) of
     the mother is male or the sex of the line number for the father (HV114) is
     female.

3.   There are 65 cases in which the respondent's reporting being at the school
     differs from the information provided in the household.

4.   There are 6 cases in which the respondent's age (V012) appears inconsistent
     with number of years of education (V133).

5.   In 4 cases the respondent did not provide information on literacy (V108 =
     missing); however later she declared that she read newspapers at least once
     a week.

6.   There are 2 cases in which the imputed age at death B7 is inconsistent with
     the declared age at death B6.  B7 had to be adjusted to fit in the interval.

7.   There is 1 case of a woman who had never menstruated (V215 = 996) but she had
     children (V210 = 01).

8.   There are 59 cases in which the time since last menstrual period (V215)
     exceeds the interval since the last birth and date of the interview.

9.   There are 5 cases of women whose partners where sterilized at some point
     (V305(7) = 1), however they do not report current use of male sterilization
     (V312 <> 7).

10.  There are 4 cases of women who declared that they are currently using a
     contraceptive method (V312 <> 0) but in column 1 of the calendar they are not
     using a method.  In 1 of those cases the women gave birth in the month of the
     interview.  In 2 other cases the woman is currently using according to the
     calendar but not using according to V312.

11.  There are 24 cases of children who died and whose age at death was reported
     as one year.

12.  There are 6 births for which the duration of amenorrhea (M6, M7) extends
     beyond the following pregnancy, when compared with the calendar.

13.  There are 10 sets of twins that have some differences between variables M1
     to M17.  All of these variables are related to prenatal care and assistance
     at delivery and therefore should be the same for multiple births.

14.  There is one case of a woman who is not breastfeeding her last child but is
     currently breastfeeding the penultimate child.  As a result, V404 (currently
     breastfeeding) is inconsistent with M4 for the last child and V407 and V408
     (times breastfed during day and night), are not applicable because this
     information is only asked of last births currently being breastfed.

15.  There are 28 cases in which are inconsistencies between duration of
     amenorrhea (M6 and M7), the time since last period (V215) and the open
     interval.  In the majority of these cases, the period has not returned (M6
     = 96) but the last period reported in V215 occurred near the conception of
     the last birth.

16.  There are 26 cases in which there are inconsistencies between duration of
     abstinence (M6 and M7), the time since last sex (V527) and the open interval.
     In the majority of these cases, sex was not resumed (M8 = 96) but last sex
     in V527 occurred near the conception of the last birth.

17.  There are 234 cases of children who were given something to drink or eat on
     the previous day (M37x), but when asked for the number of days that a
     particular food was given in the last seven days (M40x), the answer was none.
     Of the 234 cases, 2 of them correspond to plain water, 39 to any kind of milk
     (other than breast milk), 140 to other liquids (other than plain water or
     milk), 24 to eggs/fish/poultry, 14 to meat, and 15 to other solid foods.

18.  There are 12 children whose dates of vaccination are inconsistent.  For
     instance, the polio 3 vaccination was given at an earlier date than the polio
     2.  In 51 other cases the number of days between vaccinations was less than
     7 days.

19.  There are 7 children who are missing data for either weight (HW2 = missing)
     or height (HW3 = missing) and the code for reason for not measured was 0
     (HW13 = 0).

20.  There are 322 cases of children who were less than 24 months old and were
     measured standing (HW15=2) or who were 24 months or older and were measured
     lying down (HW15=1).

21.  There are 266 cases in which there are inconsistencies between HW14 (BCG scar
     on arm or shoulder) and H2 (received BCG).

22.  There are 2 cases in which variable V501 (current marital status) is missing
     but it is known that these women were previously married (V502 = 2).  16
     women were married before their 10th birthday.

23.  There are 5 cases in which the respondent reported never having had sex, but
     she has been married.

24.  There are 9 cases of women who have had only one union (V503 =1 ) and it
     occurred after January, 1989 (the beginning of the calendar).  When comparing
     the date at union (V509) and the first month of union in the calendar, they
     are inconsistent.  In 14 other cases, there are inconsistencies between the
     marital status in the first month of the calendar,  the CMC at first union
     (V509) and the number of union (V503).

25.  There are 330 cases of inconsistencies between age at first sexual
     intercourse (V525) and age at first birth (V212).  When the difference
     between the two variables is more than one year, variable V531 (Age at first
     sex imputed) is assigned code 97 (inconsistent) and variable V532 (flag for
     age at first sex) is assigned code 2 (after conception >= 1 year).  If the
     difference is just one year then variable V531 keep the same value as V525
     but V532 is assigned code 3 (after conception < 1 year).

26.  There are 14 cases in which there are inconsistencies between the total ideal
     number of children (V613) and the ideal number of children by gender (V627,
     V629, and V629).

27.  There are 14 cases of women who declared that they have discussed family
     planning with their partners in the last six months (V630A = 1), but those
     women are not currently married (V502 <> 1).  It is believed that in most of
     these cases those women discussed family planning with their boy friends or
     occasional partners.

28.  There are 20 cases of inconsistencies between the time when the interview
     begins (V801) and the time when it ends (V802), for interviews with only one
     visit (V804 = 1) to complete the questionnaire.  In 1 of them the duration
     is negative; in the remaining 19 the duration is greater than 180 minutes.
     There are also 4 cases with a duration of interview less than 5 minutes,
     including one with a duration of 0 minutes.

29.  In the maternal mortality section there are 81 cases in which the respondent
     said that she had a number of preceding siblings (MMC2).  However when the
     respondent's century month code of birth (V011) is compared with the
     corresponding CMC of her siblings (MM4), there are inconsistencies.

30.  There are 3 pregnancies in the calendar with a duration other than 9 months.

31.  There are 47 cases in which either the field supervisor (HV030) or the office
     editor (HV032) of the household questionnaire is different from that of the

Notes on Recode File

1.   The Zimbabwe Men's Questionnaire was administered to all men age 15-54 living
     in every 2.5 households in the ZDHS sample (i.e., a 40 percent subsample).
     The Men's Questionnaire collected much of the same information found in the
     Women's Questionnaire, but was shorter because it did not contain questions
     on reproductive history and maternal and child health.

2.   As in the case of women, the men's questionnaire also has the AIDS and
     maternal mortality modules.  In order to keep consistency with the female
     recode, sections MREC75, MREC83, MREC84 and MREC85, were included in the
     file.  Those sections are exactly the same as the corresponding REC75, REC83,
     REC84, and REC85 in the women recode.  However, the variable names are
     different in order to allow the men's file to be used as an external file.

3.   Because of the type sample used (as described above), all variables such as
     domains (MV023), regions (MV024), sample strata (MV022) and ultimate area
     selection probability (MV033), are the same as for the women.

4.   Variables that refer to locality of the place of the interview (MV026 and
     MV134) were created from the variable locality (main town/other urban/rural)
     on the front page of the questionnaire.  However, the category "Main town"
     was split into the categories "Capital, large city" if the interview was done
     in Harare and "City" for the remaining cases.

5.   Variable MV034(i) is a vector of up to 8 elements that holds the line number
     of the wives of the respondent in the household schedule.  This variable
     should be used when linking the male with the female recode files.  Variable
     MV035 contains the number of entries in variable MV034 (up to 4 wives in the
     same household).

6.   In variables MV103 and MV141 (for non-dejure respondents) it is not possible
     to differentiate "main town" from capital or large city.  Because of that
     "main town" was classified with the code "1-city".

7.   Unlike the core questionnaire, questions on ever use of methods in the
     contraceptive table were asked only to those men who have ever had sex,
     regardless of whether they know the method. In variables MV305(i) those
     respondents who had never had sex but who know the method, were assigned code
     "0-never used'.

8.   Questions about family planning messages on the media (MV384x) refer to a
     period of six months.  In the core questionnaire those question refer to the
     last few months.

9.   Question M412 is used to construct variable MV602.  When constructing MV602
     those respondents who are sterilized or whose wives are sterilized are
     classified under code 4 (sterilized).  In order to keep the original values,
     question M412 was also kept as a country specific variable.

10.  Variable MV603 doesn't fully agreed with variable MV616 because there are 3
     men who are sterilized (male or female), but still want more children.

11.  In variable MV740 the original category "2-communal/resettlement land" from
     questions M124 was recoded as "family land".  The reason is that this land
     is assigned by the government and passes within the family from generation
     to generation, although there are no documents of ownership.

12.  Question M415 is used to construct variable MV612.  The original category "No
     opinion" was recoded in MV612 as "Don't know".

13.  Maternal mortality variable SMM14 (number of sibling's children) was asked
     only for those siblings who died as a result of a pregnancy or child delivery
     complication.  Variable SMM10 was asked of siblings whose death was related
     to pregnancy or delivery, unlike the core questionnaire that asks the
     question of those women who died while pregnant or within the two months
     after giving birth.

14.  The occupation codes for MV716 and the recoding to create MV717 are the same
     as those described for the women's recode.

Inconsistencies in the file

1.   There are 13 cases with a duration of interview less than 10 minutes,
     including one with a duration of 0 minutes.

2.   There are 13 cases of men who married before they were 12 years old.
