1.   The questions relating to literacy (V108 and V703) were asked for all
     respondents and their partners, rather than restricting the question to
     those respondents and partners with less than secondary education as in
     the core questionnaire.  There are seven cases on V108 and three on V703
     where the respondent or her partner could not read but had either
     secondary or higher levels of education.  In addition, respondents were
     asked only if they could or could not read and not whether they could
     read easily, with difficulty or not at all.

2.   There are 103 cases of the age at death reported as one year in the data
     file.  This should not have been allowed by the interviewer as a
     response as it is necessary to distinguish between infant and childhood
     mortality.

3.   There are five cases of the first children being born to respondents
     before the age of 10 and nine cases of marriage before the age of 10.

4.   There is one case here the respondent is currently breastfeeding, but
     the child listed in the first entry of the maternity section is dead.
     This is because the second child listed in the maternity section is its
     twin and is still being breastfed.

5.   The time of start and end of interview was recorded in a mixture of
     systems.  In some cases the 12 hour clock system was used and in others
     the 24 hour clock or military time was used.  In some questionnaires one
     system has been used for the start of interview time and the other has
     been used for the end of interview.  Variables V801 and V802 record the
     time in the units originally used, and variable V803 gives the duration
     of interview after resolving the different time systems.

6.   Variable V367 (Wanted last child) is not used due to an oversight in the
     design of the questionnaire.

7.   An extra code (3) is included in variable V707 to indicate agricultural
     work that was performed on communal lands.

Inconsistencies in Recode File

1.   There is one case of a respondent currently using an "other" method in
     V312, but she has never used any "other" methods according to V305 in
     the contraceptive knowledge and use table.

2.   There is one case of a woman being sterilized two months before the date
     of her last birth.

3.   There are four cases of methods being used in V340 (method used in the
     same month as the current method) but have not been used according to
     V305 in the contraceptive knowledge and use table.  In addition there
     are three methods reported as being used in the same month, which are
     the same methods as the current method recorded in V312.

4.   There are 18 cases of immunizations being reported as less than seven
     days after the preceding immunization.  Many of these cases are recorded
     as having the same immunization date for two different doses of the same
     immunization.

5.   There are three cases in V525 where the age at first sex is recorded as
     after the age at first birth of the respondent.
