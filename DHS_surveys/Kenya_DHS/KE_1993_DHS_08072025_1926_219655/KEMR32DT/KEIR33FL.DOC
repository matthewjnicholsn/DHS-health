2.   HV024     Taken as province, which is the largest region variable in
               the Kenya DHS III.
               Rift Valley South and North are combined into Rift Valley.

RECH1.

1.   HV105     96 = 96+ Age of household member; 99 = Missing.

2.   HV106     Education in the household. The questionnaire used in the
               Kenya DHS III survey included level "0" (Nursery), which has
               been considered as "No education".

3.   HV108     Education in single years. See also V133. The educational
               system in Kenya changed twice some years ago.
               The maximum years of primary and secondary school have been
               approximated as follows:
               If the age of the household member is less or equal to 21
               then completed primary is considered as 8 years of education
               and completed secondary as an additional 4 years of
               education.
               If age is larger than 21 and smaller or equal to 41 then
               completed primary is considered as 7 years of education and
               completed secondary as an additional 6 years of education.
               If age is larger than 41 and smaller or equal to 96 then
               completed primary is considered as 8 years of education and
               completed secondary as an additional 6 years of education.
               If age is missing the current system is assumed.


               Educational system:      before 1965:   8-4-2-3
                              1965-1985:     7-4-2-3
                              1985-present:  8-4-4

4.   HV110     If household member is still in school. Kenya uses a level
               of education category "0", nursery. This is considered in
               the recode file as not having any formal education.
               Consequently, the member of the household is considered as
               not going to school.

2.   V715 Education in single years for husband. Husbands age is unknown,
          so the respondent's age is used to determine which educational
          system should be applied to the husband. See notes on variable
          HV108.

3.   V716 Occupation codes as used in Kenya DHS III: see notes on variable
          V704.

4.   V718 Earns cash for work. If respondent declared to be self employed
          and did not earn any cash for her work, she will still be
          classified as self-employed. Self-employed in this case does not
          imply that she earns cash for her work as in some other DHSII
          surveys.


Inconsistencies in the Data File

1.        There are 9 cases with a birth interval less than 9 months.

2.        There are 2 cases where the calculated age at first birth is less
          than 10 years.

3.        Calculated duration of pregnancy. There are three cases where the
          duration of pregnancy exceeds time since last born child.

4.        Six respondents said they had never menstruated, but did have
          children. Flag variable in V227 was set to 8 for these cases.

5.        Brand name of pill was not asked, but cost of package was asked.
          There is one case with a cost for pills of 991 shillings, which
          is far out of the range of all the other answers to this
          question.

6.        Vaccination dates. There are six unedited cases with a
          vaccination date before the date of birth of the child.

7.        Births in the last five years. There are eight cases where the
          imputed date of birth falls within the five year of interview
          date, but these children were not entered in the health sections
          during data entry, because their year of birth was unknown (and
          most of the time also the month of birth). These cases have been
          included with missing data assigned to the relevant variables.

8.        There are 27 cases where twins have been coded differently for
          the variables M1-M17.

9.        There is one case, that has a result code "1" for measurement
          (completed), but both the height and weight are missing. This
          caused the data entry program to skip the date of measurement,
          i.e. made the date of measurement not applicable. For this date
          the date of measurement of the previous case has been taken. The
          result code is inconsistent for this case.

10.       There are three cases where time of the beginning of the
          interview is later then time when interview ended.

11.       There are 530 cases where the height of a child was measured
          differently from the recommended way of measuring (i.e. younger
          than 24 months lying down and older than 24 months standing up).

12.       There are 15 cases where death of child was reported outside
          recommended questionnaire ranges (days if less than one month,
          months if less than two years or else years).

13.       There are two cases where the calculated age at first birth is
          less than 10 years.

14.       There are 6 cases where the respondent declared having her last
          period before the last born child and never had children or
          declared that she never had a period but did have children.

15.       Eight cases where time when liquids or foods were given for the
          first time surpasses current age of child or age at death.

16.       Three cases where the interviewer saw a health card, but it
          contained no vaccination dates.

17.       Twenty two cases where the respondent or one of her children
          under five year of age where partly measured, while the result
          indicated full measurement.

18.       There are five cases where the first member of the household
          listing was not the head of the household.

19.       There are 333 cases where there is a inconsistency between
          observed BCG scar and vaccination for BCG (either a scar was
          observed and no vaccination date was given or a vaccination date
          was given and no scar observed).

20.       There are five cases in which the number of single years of
          education exceeds the amount expected based on the age of the
          respondent.

Coding Additions.

Country specific question S109B has been added to reflect the educational
grouping as used in the DHS Kenya Final Report:

          0 = No education
          1 = Primary incomplete
          2 = Primary complete
          3 = Secondary and more

1.   Five men reported that their wife is sterilized, but their current
     contraception method is not sterilization.
2.   There are seven cases where the manþs occupation is missing.
3.   Two interviews took longer than three hours.
4.   The wife of one man was reported in the household as being less than
     15 years old.
5.   There are two cases where the respondent was married before age 12.
6.   Data for the wives of 33 men are not present in the individual
     (womenþs) file because the interview was not complete, and 56 cases
     where the wife was not eligible for interview.
7.   Two men claim to have 50 children, one claims to have 60.
8.   There are 1257 cases where data from the womenþs recode file can be
     correctly matched with husbands in the male recode file.  This
     includes polygynous relationships, where each couple is counted once.
     There are 233 cases where the line numbers for husbands based on the
     household questionnaire (SM16A and B) or MV034 are incorrect.
9.   Sources for MV762, þSource for Condoms,þ are (1) SM311 (source for
     current method) if the current method is condom, (2) SM322 if the
     future preferred method is the condom, or (3), if the respondent knows
     where to get condoms (based on the contraceptive table), MV762 is set
     to missing.  Otherwise, MV762 is set to 98 (þdonþt know sourceþ).
10.  The educational system in Kenya changed twice some years ago.
     Education level as it appears in the final report is in SM108, a
     country-specific variable.  For the standard education variables, the
     maximum years of primary and secondary school have been approximated
     as follows:

     1.   If the age of the household member is 21 or less then completed
          primary is considered as 8 years of education and completed
          secondary as an additional 4 years of education.
     2.   If the age is greater than 21 but less than or equal to 41 then
          completed primary is considered as 7 years of education and
          completed secondary as an additional 6 years of education.
     3.   If the age is greater than 41 but less than or equal to 96 then
          completed primary is considered as 8 years of education and
          completed secondary as an additional 6 years of education.
     4.   If the age is missing, the current system is assumed:
          1.   before 1965:   8-4-2-3
          2.   1965-1985:     7-4-2-3
          3.   1985-present:  8-4-4

Inconsistencies in the Data File

1.   Four men include line numbers for a wife but have indicated that they
     are not currently married.
2.   Eight men indicated that their wife is sterilized but they are not
     currently using a contraception method.
3.   There is one case where the reported end of interview is earlier than
     when it began.
4.   In 13 cases, the ideal number of children is not equal to the ideal
     numbers of boys plus girls plus either.  This is due in part to the
     non-standard structure of the questionnaire and its skip pattern.
5.   In 8 cases, the literacy (MV108) variable is missing, although the
     respondent reportedly read a newspaper at least once a week.
