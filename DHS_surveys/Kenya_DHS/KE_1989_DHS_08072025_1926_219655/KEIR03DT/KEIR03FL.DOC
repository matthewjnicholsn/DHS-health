REC97         Husband's Questionnaire Cover Page and Husband's Background

       *****  It should be noted that in the husband data, there are two
              types of variable names - those that begin with SHV and those
              that begin with SH.  The variable names that include a "V"
              have the same standard codes as the respondent's variables.
              For example, SHV103 for the husband is equivalent to V103 for
              the respondent.  The other husband variable names refer to the
              original question number in the husband's questionnaire.

              Variable SHV005 should be used to weight the data when
              analyzing the husband's data.  Results may vary slightly from
              those reported in the First Country report since the
              individual woman's weight variable was used for that analysis.

3.     Only those husbands who had a complete interview have been added to the file.  Using the variable SWIFE1 permits
       the user correct access to the data.  If the variable is not applicable (blank), no husband was interviewed or the
       interview was incomplete.  If the variable is equal to one, the data can be used to analyze the husband file.  If the
       variable is equal to zero or one, the data can be used to analyze couples in the data file.  The husband's data should
       be weighted with the variable SHV005/1000000.

4.     The following are exceptions to standard coding of variables related to a variable coded as missing.

       a)     If V606 is coded missing, V607 is coded as not applicable.
       b)     If V704 is coded missing, V706 through V708 are coded as not applicable.
       c)     If V709 is coded missing, V710 is coded as not applicable.

5.     The country specific variable S520A, age at first sex as originally recorded was kept in the file since so many cases had
       an age at first sex that was inconsistent with the conception of the first reported birth or too long after the age
       reported for first marriage.

6.     The country specific variables S315R and S315CR, originally reported source of currently used contraceptive method,
       have been retained.  As analysis began, inconsistencies between funding agencies and the type of source were found.
       The basic problem was in the respondent perception of FPAK clinics as hospitals.  The data were corrected based on
       responses found in the Contraceptive Knowledge and Ever Use table.  The corrected responses are found in V326.
Inconsistencies in the data file

1.     There are two respondents whose age and years of education appear to be inconsistent - that is, the number of years
       of education appear to be too great for the age of the respondent.

2.     There are 9 respondents who report ever having used female sterilization while reporting current use of no method
       or some other method.

3.     There are 15 respondents who report their first marriage as having occurred before they reached the age of 10.

4.     There are 3 husbands who report ever use of male sterilization while reporting current use of no method or some other
       method.

Differences from version 1 to version 2

1.     A modification to the editing and imputation rules was made affecting V525 (Age at first sex).  Previously, if the age
       at first sex was after the age at first marriage, the age at first sex was changed to the inconsistent code.  This rule has
       now been dropped and the original data for age at first sex is now used.  A similar editing rule, in which age at first
       sex is coded inconsistent if after age at first birth, is still in effect and is standard in DHS surveys.

Differences from version 2 to version 3

1.     Because of an inconsistency between age at first sex and the birth history, the imputation program produced bad birth
       histories for five cases in which there was no information for the date of the first birth.  Each of these cases were found
       to contain negative birth intervals between certain births.  V525 was changed to 97 for each of these cases using an
       automatic correction program.  Two additional cases of inconsistency between this variable and a first birth were
       discovered and these cases were also corrected by coding V525 as 97.
